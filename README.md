[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

WARNING! THIS INTEGRATION IS BROKEN SINCE LUMINUS DEPRECATED THIS LOGIN METHOD
See open issues for some details on new implementation, incomplete still. 

This project is an attempt to create an integration to consume services provided by
My Luminus Apps for contract and metering management.

## How

All you need for this integration to work is your My Luminus login

This project isn't published to the default integrations in HACS yet cause that requires branding. 

For now you either have to install it manually by dropping the custom_components
folder contents into your HA installation. Or by adding this repo as a custom
repo within HACS. For that, within HACS just select "add repo" then pick "integration"
as type and enter a name and the url of this repo. Or read here https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/

Then you can add a new integration, search for "My Luminus" to find this one:

Next you'll get a quick installation wizard, enter your credentials here:

Once done this integration should be visible in your settings.

## Why?

Because we can!

## Limitations

For now just some sensors, still figuring out how to push data to the api from within HA.

* language options for now are limited to 'fr' and 'nl' because of API limitations.
